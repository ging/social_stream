# An {Actor} represents a social entity. This means {User individuals},
# but also {Group groups}, departments, organizations even nations or states.
#
# Actors are the nodes of a social network. Two actors are linked by {Tie Ties}. The
# type of a {Tie} is a {Relation}. Each actor can define and customize their relations own
# {Relation Relations}.
#
# Every {Actor} has an Avatar, a {Profile} with personal or group information, contact data, etc.
#
# {Actor Actors} perform {ActivityAction actions} (like, suscribe, etc.) on
# {ActivityObject activity objects} ({Post posts}, {Comment commments}, pictures, events..)
#
# = Actor subtypes
# An actor subtype is called a {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subject}.
# {SocialStream::Base} provides two actor subtypes, {User} and {Group}, but the
# application developer can define as many actor subtypes as required.
# Besides including the {SocialStream::Models::Subject} module, Actor subtypes
# must added to +config/initializers/social_stream.rb+
