# A {Tie} is a link between two {Actor Actors},
# and therefore, two {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects}.
#
# It is made up with a {Contact} and a {Relation}. The {Contact} defines the sender
# or {Actor} that declares the link, and the receiver or {Actor} that is pointed by
# the declaration. The {Relation} defines the type of link (friend, colleague,
# {Relation::Reject}, etc)

# = Authorization
# When an {Actor} establishes a {Tie} with other, she is granting a set of
# {Permission Permissions} to them (posting to her wall, reading her posts, etc..)
# The set of {Permission Permissions} granted are associated with the {Relation} of
# the {Tie}.
#
# = Scopes
# There are several scopes defined:
#
# sent_by(actor):: ties whose sender is actor
# received_by(actor):: ties whose receiver is actor
# sent_or_received_by(actor):: the union of the former
# related_by(relation):: ties with this relation. Accepts relation, relation_name,
#                        integer, array
#
