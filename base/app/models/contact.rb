# A {Contact} is an ordered pair of {Actor Actors},
# and therefore two {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects}.
#
# {Contact Contacts} are created at convenience (in the case of {Actor#suggestions suggestions},
# for instance), and they do not mean that there is a real link between those two
# {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects}. Link existance is stored as a {Tie}.
# When Alice adds Bob as contact, a new {Tie} is created with the {Contact} from Alice to
# Bob and the {Relation} that Alice chose.
#
# == Inverse Contacts
#
# Alice has a {Contact} to Bob. The inverse is the {Contact} from {Bob} to {Alice}.
# Inverse contacts are used to check if contacts are replied, for instance, if Bob added
# Alice as contact after she did so.
#
# Again, the Contact from Bob to Alice must have positive {Tie ties} to be active.
#
class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
