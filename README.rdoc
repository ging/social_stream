= Social Stream components

Social Stream is divided into components. Developers can customize their social
network with the functionalities they need for each case. Current Social Stream distribution include the following components:

* {Base}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/base], basic functionalities of contacts, streams and walls,
  along with users, group, post and comments
* {Documents}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/documents], support for
  activities on files: pictures, audio and video with a HTML5 player
* {Events}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/events], sheduled events with calendar
* {Linkser}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/linkser], advanced management of links to other webpages
* {Presence}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/presence], XMPP based chat support 
* {Ostatus}[https://github.com/ging/social_stream/tree/master/ostatus], support for social network federation
 
= Installation

Add the following to the Gemfile of the your Rails application:

  gem 'social_stream', '>= 1.0.0'

In the case you do not want some functionality, include your desired components instead.
For instance, the Gemfile in an application using documents and links only would contain the following:

  gem 'social_stream-documents'
  gem 'social_stream-linkser'


Then run:

  bundle

Then:

  rails generate social_stream:install

or use specific generators if you are using components.

Social Stream is not compatible with {default mass attributes protection shipped with Rails 3.2.3}[http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/30/ann-rails-3-2-3-has-been-released/], but uses the {strong_parameters gem}[https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters] that will be the default in Rails 4. Set this in your config/application.rb before running the migration command:

  config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = false

Now migrate your database

  rake db:migrate

Since {Social Stream}[http://github.com/ging/social_stream] depends on {Devise}[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise], make sure you follow {its setup instructions}[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/tree/master/lib/generators/templates#readme]. Specifically, make sure you set the default URL options for your environments at <tt>config/environments/*.rb</tt> with something like:

  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
